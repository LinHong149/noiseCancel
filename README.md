# Noise Cancellation System

A real-time Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) system implemented in Python with a Next.js frontend interface.

## Project Overview

This project implements a sophisticated real-time noise cancellation system that uses adaptive filtering algorithms to actively cancel unwanted noise. The system consists of a Python backend that handles the audio processing and a Next.js frontend for user interface.

## System Architecture

### Backend (Python)
- **Real-time audio processing** using `sounddevice` and `scipy`
- **Adaptive filtering algorithms** for noise cancellation
- **Secondary path identification** for system modeling
- **Block-based processing** for low-latency performance

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Modern React-based interface** with TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Responsive design** for various screen sizes

## Backend Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Audio Configuration
```python
SR = 48000              # Sample rate: 48kHz
BLOCKSIZE = 1024        # Processing block size
AGG_DEVICE = 5          # Aggregate Device for routing
REF_CH = 0              # Reference channel (iPhone)
ERR_CH = 1              # Error channel (Built-in microphone)
OUT_CH = 0              # Output channel (Bedroom speaker)
```

#### 2. FIR Filter Class
A custom FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter implementation for blockwise convolution:
- Maintains filter state between blocks
- Uses `scipy.signal.lfilter` for efficient processing
- Handles filter taps and delay state

#### 3. Secondary Path Identification
The system first identifies the secondary path (speaker-to-microphone transfer function):
- **Excitation signal**: Random noise at low amplitude (0.05 gain)
- **NLMS algorithm**: Normalized Least Mean Squares for adaptation
- **Duration**: 2 seconds of identification
- **Purpose**: Models the acoustic path from speaker to error microphone

#### 4. ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) Class
The main noise cancellation engine:
- **Adaptive filter**: 256-tap FIR filter (W)
- **Reference buffer**: Stores recent reference signal samples
- **Secondary path buffer**: Stores samples for secondary path modeling
- **Leaky LMS algorithm**: Prevents filter divergence
- **Output limiting**: Clips output to prevent audio distortion

### Algorithm Details

#### Secondary Path Identification Process
1. Generate random excitation signal
2. Play through output speaker while recording reference and error signals
3. Use NLMS to estimate the secondary path transfer function
4. Store the identified path for use in main ANC algorithm

#### Main ANC Algorithm
For each audio block:
1. **Update reference buffer** with new input samples
2. **Generate anti-noise signal** using adaptive filter W
3. **Model secondary path** using identified transfer function
4. **Update filter coefficients** using leaky LMS:
   ```
   W = (1 - LEAK) * W + MU * e * (xhat / norm) * xbuf
   ```
5. **Limit output** to prevent clipping and distortion

### Key Parameters
- **MU (Î¼)**: Learning rate (0.0005) - controls adaptation speed
- **LEAK**: Leakage factor (1e-5) - prevents filter divergence
- **OUT_LIMIT**: Output limiting (0.3) - prevents audio distortion
- **Filter lengths**: 256 taps for both W and secondary path

### 5. Audio Quality
**Challenge**: Maintaining audio quality while applying noise cancellation
**Solution**:
